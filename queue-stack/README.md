# Queue & Stack


## Stack (linked-list)

Time complexity: constant :)
Space complexity: 16 bytes (object overhead) + 8 bytes (inner class extra overhead) + 8 bytes (refrence to String) + 8 bytes (reference to Node) = 40 bytes per stack node


## Stack (array)
Array implementation of stack is faster than linked-list however we have to deal with the stack overflows issue when the number of items in the stack exceeds the capacity of the array.# online-courses
